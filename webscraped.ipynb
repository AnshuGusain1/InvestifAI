      "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Tracking Transparency (ATT) tool, which lets iPhone users control which apps track their activity, is reportedly under investigation by French antitrust regulators, according to Reuters.\n",
      "Some digital advertisers and mobile gaming companies have complained that ATT has made it more expensive to advertise on Apple devices. French regulators are said to be weighing whether the tool is anti-competitive, with a ruling expected as soon as next month. If Apple is found to have violated regulations, it could be forced to shut down ATT in France or face a fine.\n",
      "Apple describes ATT as a framework that provides users with a tracking authorization request and their tracking status. However, its impact on the mobile ad industry has drawn regulatory attention worldwide.\n",
      "The French probe comes shortly after Apple clashed with the U.K. government over end-to-end encryption. The U.K. Home Office ordered Apple to create a backdoor allowing access to user cloud data, a request Apple rejected by removing its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) security feature from the U.K.\n",
      "U.S. officials have also weighed in, with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard calling the U.K.'s demand for a security backdoor an egregious violation of U.S. rights. Apple has since confirmed that new U.K. users won't have access to ADP, and current users will eventually need to disable the feature.\n",

      "Apple on Thursday announced a range of new initiatives designed to help parents and developers create a safer experience for kids and teens using Apple devices. In addition to easier setup of child accounts, parents will now be able to share information about their kids' ages, which can then be accessed by app developers to provide age-appropriate content. The App Store will also introduce a new set of age ratings that give developers and App Store users alike a more granular understanding of an app's appropriateness for a given age range.\n",
      "Product pages for third-party apps on the App Store will also be updated to include additional information that can help guide parents' decisions, like whether an app features user-generated content or ads, or if the app offers its own parental controls.\n",
      "These updates will roll out to parents and developers later this year, Apple says.\n",
      "The changes arrive amid ongoing legislative disputes both at the state and federal levels over how tech companies should be protecting children online. Nine U.S. states, including Utah and South Carolina, have recently proposed bills that would require app store operators like Apple to check kids' ages in order to get parental consent before minors can download apps, for instance.\n",
      "Apple historically has pushed for third-party app developers to verify kids' ages, while large tech companies like Meta have lobbied that app store operators should handle age verification as they have this information about their users already.\n",
      "The iPhone maker's new solution is something of a compromise. It puts Apple in the position of collecting kids' ages via parental input but still puts the onus on the third-party developer to extract and use this information to craft age-appropriate experiences in their own apps.\n",
      "Apple's system begins with an easier setup process for child accounts, which are required for kids under the age of 13 and are optional for young people up to age 18.\n",
      "When setting up a new child account, a parent can now select the age range for their child. The parent will also be able to verify they're the adult in the household by confirming their payment history with their credit card already on file with Apple. (Previously, they would have to enter their credit card information manually, which could be a hassle.)\n",
      "If the parent can't immediately set up their child's device, the child will now have the option to set up their iPhone or iPad on their own. Here, Apple will automatically apply age-appropriate web content filters and will allow kids to use the apps that come preinstalled on the devices, like Notes, Pages, Keynote, and others. Neither app developers nor Apple will be able to collect the kids' data without the parent's consent during this time.\n",
      "Kids will be reminded to ask a parent to complete the setup process when they visit the App Store and try to download an app for the first time.\n",
      "When the child's setup is completed by the parent, kids will be able to use the App Store and other Apple services under the protection of the content and app restrictions their parent chose.\n",
      "The most notable part of this new system is how third-party developers verify kids' ages using this information.\n",
      "Instead of asking kids to input their birthdays, as many social apps do today, developers will have the option to use a new Declared Age Range API that allows them to access the age range information the parent input during the child account setup. (Parents can also correct this information at any time if it was originally entered incorrectly).\n",
      "Through the API, developers gain access to an age range for the child so they can customize their app experiences appropriately. They will not have access to the child's birthdate. Parents can also revoke this permission further down the road if need be, Apple says.\n",
      "From the child's perspective, if an app needs their age information, it will display a pop-up message asking them if they want to share their age range with the app. This is similar to other permission requests that apps use for accessing more private features like a user's location, microphone, camera, or photo gallery.\n",
      "It's also a more effective system, given that kids often lie about their birthday to access an app's full experience instead of the one curated for their age range.\n",
      "As an opt-in system, developers will have to do the work of integrating with the new API. And if any of the state legislative bills move forward, perhaps some developers or categories of apps will be required by law to do so in the future.\n",
      "A final change involves an update to the existing age rating system on the App Store itself. Currently, there are four age ranges available for apps: 4+ years old, 9+ years old, 12+, and 17+. The new system will break down teenagers' ages into more granular ranges of 13+, 16+, and 18+, while still retaining the 4+ and 9+ ranges.\n",
      "An app's age range is determined by the developer's answers to a set of questions from Apple about the content in their app, as well as the frequency and intensity of that content, the company says.\n",
      "This will help parents better determine if an app their child requests is age-appropriate when a child requests a new app. Plus, if content restrictions are set up, kids are prevented from downloading and updating apps that exceed their age range.\n",
      "What's more, Apple's App Store won't feature restricted apps in areas like the editorial stories, Today, Games, and Apps tabs, when they aren't age-appropriate for the child.\n",
      "Several of the changes for child accounts are available in the public beta of iOS 18.4, out now. The ability to make updates to the age of a child account after it’s already created, as well as the Declared Age Range API, Age Ratings and App Store updates will be available later this year, Apple says.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Apple has been sued by consumers who said its claim that three versions of Apple Watches are \"carbon neutral\" and environmentally friendly is false and misleading.\n",
      "In a complaint filed on Wednesday in San Jose, California federal court, seven purchasers of the green-tagged Apple Watch Series 9, SE and Ultra 2 said they would not have bought their watches or would have paid less had they known the truth.\n",
      "Apple, also known for the iPhone, launched the watches in September 2023, saying they would be carbon neutral through a combination of lower emissions and purchases of carbon offsets.\n",
      "But the plaintiffs--from California, Florida and Washington, D.C.--said two carbon offsetting projects on which Apple relied to meet its corporate emissions target did not provide \"genuine\" carbon reductions.\n",
      "They said much of the land in Kenya's Chyulu Hills Project lies within a national park protected from deforestation since 1983, while land for China's Guinan Project was heavily covered by trees even before the project began in 2015.\n",
      "\"In both cases, the carbon reductions would have occurred regardless of Apple's involvement or the projects' existence,\" the complaint said. \"Because Apple's carbon neutrality claims are predicated on the efficacy and legitimacy of these projects, Apple’s carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading.\"\n",
      "The plaintiffs also said 70% of U.S. and Canadian consumers consider environmental sustainability crucial when making purchases, citing a study by the National Retail Federation and IBM.\n",
      "In a statement on Thursday responding to the lawsuit, Apple did not discuss the case but defended its environmental record.\n",
      "\"We've drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over 75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from the air,\" it said. \"We detail our work prominently and transparently for our users.\"\n",
      "The Cupertino, California-based company has aimed to be carbon neutral by 2030, including in its supply chain.\n",
      "Wednesday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction blocking Apple from marketing the three watches as carbon neutral.\n",

      "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple is facing a likely antitrust fine as the French regulator prepares to rule next month on the company's privacy control tool, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n",
      "Called App Tracking Transparency (ATT), the feature allows iPhone users to decide which apps can track user activity, helping companies like Meta Platforms' Facebook and online advertisers tailor ads to users and measure their impact.\n",
      "Digital advertising and mobile gaming companies including Facebook say it has made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on Apple's platforms.\n",
      "The French regulator charged Apple in 2023, saying it was concerned that the company might \"abuse its dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes\".\n",
      "It is expected to issue its decision next month ordering Apple to halt its anti-competitive practice and will likely impose a fine too, the people said, making it the first regulatory veto against the ATT.\n",
      "French antitrust fines can be as much as 10% of a company's global annual revenue.\n",
      "\"The decision is expected in the spring. But we can't comment any further,\" the regulator said.\n",
      "Apple referred to a July 2023 statement in which it said it holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer and that it had previously received strong support from the French regulator and privacy watchdog on the goal of the ATT.\n",

      "Apple (AAPL) has added the iPhone 16E, starting at $599, to its new phone line as a more budget-friendly option. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth to share three standout features of the iPhone 16e, which will be in stores on Friday.\n",
      "To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.\n",
      "This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n",
      "Sign in to access your portfolio\n",
      "Apple delivered its latest budget handset, the $599 iPhone 16e, without pomp. There was no big event in person, nor was there one online. No journalists scrambled through hoards of colleagues to snap photos of the phone. Instead, CEO Tim Cook tweeted out that new hardware was on the way, days before Apple announced the handset via a press release.\n",
      "Accordingly, the 16e isn’t an exciting device. It’s a safe one. It’s an amalgam of earlier iPhones in a bid to create a product that’s reliable, while keeping costs down. The handset most closely resembles the iPhone 13 and 14, both in dimensions and the inclusion of the display notch up top. The iPhone 15’s Action button is here, but the 16’s Camera Control is absent.\n",
      "From an innovation standpoint, the iPhone 16e’s most exciting element would have to be its custom C1 modem. That’s not a sentiment you hear too often. Modems are decidedly unsexy. Most consumers only ever acknowledge their existence when theirs goes on the fritz. But it’s not the technology that makes the component interesting. It’s the fact that this is the first time Apple has made one.\n",
      "While the 16e borrows liberally from earlier Apple handsets, there are elements of the company’s latest flagship that help justify Apple’s new naming scheme. The strongest argument in favor of ditching the familiar iPhone SE branding is the inclusion of another component: the A18. That’s the same processor found on the regular iPhone 16.\n",
      "This is important for a couple of reasons. The first is that the 16e is $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16, which was, up to now, the cheapest way to get the chip. The second and more important is future-proofing. Apple will continue supporting the chip longer than it will the iPhone 15's A16 chip.\n",
      "Beyond bug fixes and security updates, future-proofing also includes Apple Intelligence, the nascent generative AI platform the company is banking on as the future of iPhone. Before last week, the existing iPhone 16 line and the most expensive iPhone 15 models were the only iOS devices capable of running the feature.\n",
      "Don’t get things tangled, though. The star of this show isn’t a particular piece of silicon. It’s the price. Pricing, after all, is why analysts have pointed to the iPhone 16e’s potential to help Apple make up for lost ground in key markets like China and India. In the grand scheme of things, a $200 price drop from the entry-level iPhone isn’t huge, but every bit counts, particularly in developing markets where true flagships can struggle.\n",
      "But dropping the price point doesn’t automatically translate to a deluge of new iPhone users. Apple faces extremely stiff competition from domestic manufacturers in China — a phenomenon that’s only likely to worsen as trade tensions increase.\n",
      "There are other complicated factors in markets like India, where both the iPhone 14 and 15 will be around to purchase through retail channels for a while. The iPhone 14’s discontinuation makes finding a new one far more difficult here in the U.S., but the iPhone 15 is still officially available here, starting at $699.\n",
      "Elements like these obscure the 16e’s position in the current iPhone lineup. A $100 price difference between it and the 15 is significant, but it’s nowhere near the price gulf some Android manufacturers put between their mid-tier and flagship devices. Serviceable, cheap Android devices have never been in short demand. The iPhone 16e isn’t a budget device per se because Apple doesn’t make budget devices.\n",
      "Further blurring the lines is the fact that the 16e’s iPhone 14-inspired design doesn’t feel like throwback in the way the last SE did when it was launched in 2022. While the 16e still sports the display notch rather than the Dynamic Island (introduced on the 14 Pro), the overall design of the line hasn’t radically changed over the last couple of years. For this reason, the 16e feels like a “modern” iPhone in a way the last SE didn't.\n",
      "That’s a benefit for most potential buyers, but there will undoubtedly be those who will mourn the end of Touch ID in favor of Face ID. The 16e’s arrival also heralds the end of the “small” iPhone. Some will miss the more compact, 4.7-inch display found on the last SE. The 16e’s arrival means that you can no longer purchase an iPhone with a screen under 6 inches.\n",
      "The iPhone 15, iPhone 16e, and iPhone 16 all sport a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display. The screens are largely the same, but there are a few key differences. The 16e has a notch in the place of the Dynamic Island and tops out at 1,200 nits of brightness compared to the maximum 2,000 nits on the other models. The three handsets share nearly identical footprints and weights.\n",
      "All three sport a USB-C port by law, though the 16e doesn’t feature the MagSafe connector on the rear. The handset does charge through the Qi standard, though its speeds top out at 7.5 watts, to the 15’s 15 watts and the 16’s 25 watts. The 16e sports the longest stated battery life of the three phones, at 26 hours to the 16’s 22 hours and the 15’s 20 hours. The new C1 modem played an important part in the 16e extended battery life, being both less power hunger than older silicon and smaller in a way that allowed the company to free up space for a larger battery than the iPhone 16.\n",
      "Both the iPhone 16 and 16e sport the latest A18 chip with a six-core CPU and 16-core neural engine. The 16e takes a bit of a hit on the graphics processing side with a four-core GPU to the 16’s five cores. All three phones start at 128GB of storage, upgradable to both 256GB or 512GB. The 16 and 16e, meanwhile, sport 8GB of RAM to the 15’s 6GB. That little extra boost of RAM should help with some of that on-device Apple Intelligence processing.\n",
      "Apple Intelligence currently features text rewrite, summaries, and generative imagery, created through Image Playground. Is the ability to run Apple’s answer to Google Gemini enough reason to opt for the 16e over the less intelligent iPhone 15? The platform’s usefulness will, of course, vary dramatically between individuals in its current form. But these are very much early days.\n",
      "Apple is committed to its generative AI offering, and it’s set to be the centerpiece of updates for years to come. I can’t promise any life-changing features on the horizon, but it’s entirely possible you’ll kick yourself in a year or two for deprioritizing the technology. \n",
      "Visual Intelligence — Apple’s answer to Google Lens — is also available on the 16e, though the absence of the Camera Control feature means you’ll have to access it by means of the Action Button. More notable than the absence of Camera Control, however, is the presence of a single camera on the rear of the iPhone 16e.\n",
      "Apple glossed over this fact during the announcement, instead highlighting what it calls a \"2-in-1\" camera system. Through the magic of computational photography, the iPhone 16e is a single-camera smartphone that \"feels\" like a two-camera system. This boils down to the 48-megapixel sensor with “integrated telephoto,” which means the image will give you a closer, 12-megapixel version of the image, without majorly sacrificing image quality for zoom.\n",
      "You will inevitably lose versatility moving from two image sensors to one, even if said image sensor utilizes fancy fusion technology. For some users, this alone is enough to justify the added $100 to $200 to get the iPhone 15 or 16 instead. That said, the 16e is capable of getting some nice shots for a single-sensor handset and certainly marks a big leap over the last iPhone SE.\n",
      "Every time the price drops by $100, you’re sacrificing something. That's how profit margins work. Choosing the best \"entry-level\" iPhone in the current lineup is less straightforward than it might have been in the past. It comes down to what features you need and what you’re willing to do without.\n",
      "The 16e is an exercise in feature prioritization. If you need the latest everything, eat the extra $200 and get the regular iPhone 16. If Apple Intelligence isn't a priority, the iPhone 15 has you covered.\n",
      "In the end, there’s surprisingly little daylight between the iPhone 16 and 16e. It prioritizes Apple Intelligence through the inclusion of the A18 and 8GB of RAM. The handset makes sacrifices in the name of affordability, like MagSafe, Dynamic Island, Camera Control, and the dual-camera system. If you can live without all those, by all means, save yourself the $200. \n",

      "Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 16e, the latest addition to the company's iPhone 16 family, hits stores Friday for $599. I've been using the budget-friendly phone for the past few days, and despite its relatively low price, it still provides many of the features you'd expect from the company's higher-end phones.\n",
      "You get Apple's A18 processor, which means you can run Apple Intelligence, something you can't do on the $699 iPhone 15 and $799 Phone 15 Plus; Face ID; the Action button; and an updated camera system compared to the one found on the aging iPhone SE the 16e replaces. This is also the first phone to come with Apple's C1 chip, the company's first modem designed in-house.\n",
      "But you do miss out on a handful of features, including multiple camera lenses and Apple's Camera Control button. Still, for the price, the iPhone 16e is a top-notch choice if you're looking for a newer smartphone that won't drain your wallet.\n",
      "The iPhone 16e, like the iPhone 14, includes a cutout at the top of the phone's screen that houses its Face ID camera and sensors. That means you don't get the Dynamic Island found on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro that provides information like sports scores or updates for apps like Uber. I find the Dynamic Island especially handy for tracking my fantasy team's score during football season, but it's not exactly a must-have.\n",
      "The 16e does get Apple's customizable Action button, which I set up to launch my phone's flashlight, but it can also fire up the camera or translation apps, among other options.\n",
      "Around back, the iPhone 16e gets a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera. Apple's iPhone 16 gets a two-camera setup that includes standard and ultrawide-angle lenses. The iPhone 16 Pro gets both of those and a telephoto lens with 5x zoom. But the iPhone 16e's camera does include a 2x optical-like zoom option.\n",
      "The photos I took with the iPhone 16e were clear and crisp, though I do wish Apple included an ultrawide-angle lens, which is a huge help when trying to take group shots. If you're the type of person who takes tons of snaps, I'd suggest opting for the standard iPhone 16 or jumping to the 16 Pro. But if you're just taking casual photos here and there, the 16e is more than up to the task.\n",
      "Importantly, the iPhone 16e is the first iPhone to use Apple's new C1 modem. Designed in-house by Apple, the modem replaces the Qualcomm (QCOM) chips Apple used in previous iPhone models, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lines.\n",
      "The move is meant to wean Apple from using third-party components, cutting down on the amount it pays for parts and allowing it to further customize its products' designs. So far, I haven't noticed any major changes to my experience when it comes to browsing the web, scrolling through social media apps, or streaming videos. And that's about what most people would prefer.\n",
      "If, however, you're hoping to get access to millimeter wave 5G, you're out of luck — the iPhone 16e doesn't support the high-end network connection. That said, I saw speeds as high as 672 megabits per second when using the Speedtest app on my test phone. For reference, my home internet connection is 500 mbps.\n",
      "As far as battery life goes, Apple says the iPhone 16e gets up to 26 hours of video playback. In my experience, the 16e provided ample power throughout the day. After charging it throughout the night, the battery was only down to 72% at 3 p.m. despite streaming music and browsing the web here and there.\n",
      "Overall, the iPhone 16e is a quality option for users looking for a lower-cost iPhone. If you're in the market for a new smartphone that won't leave your wallet hurting, Apple's latest is a great choice. But if you want a phone with all the bells and whistles, you'll have to shell out more for the standard 16 or 16 Pro.\n",

      "Apple (AAPL, Financials) reached an agreement with Indonesia to invest in the country, leading to the lifting of a ban on iPhone 16 sales, according to Indonesian officials, Bloomberg News said Tuesday, citing people privy to the matter.\n",
      "Announcement of the agreement came from Indonesian Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita at a media conference in Jakarta. Indonesia's Ministry of Industry would grant Apple permission to sell the iPhone 16 series in the nation, with 278 million inhabitants, as per the deal.\n",
      "The agreement calls for Apple building a manufacturing plant on Batam Island to create AirTags, the tracking gadget used by the firm. Operating the plant will be Luxshare Precision Industry, a major Apple supplier.\n",
      "Beginning in October 2024, the accord marks the conclusion of a five-month dispute started by Indonesia's ban of Apple 16 sales over unfulfilled local investment criteria. Apple first suggested spending $100 million over two years, hence strengthening its commitment from an earlier $10 million pledge. Later on, the business increased their suggested investment to $1 billion.\n",
      "Indonesian authorities questioned the $1 billion commitment in January, claiming it was inadequate and advised Apple to produce smartphone components locally instead of accessories like AirTags, effectively rejecting the guarantee. Notwithstanding the reservations, both sides reached an agreement before the end of January, resulting in the already announced arrangement.\n",
      "Apple has not revealed any specifics on the planned Batam Island plant manufacturing capacity or the investment schedule.\n",

      "We recently published a list of 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best magic formula stocks for 2025.\n",
      "The Magic Formula, as defined by Joel Greenblatt in his book The Little Book that Beats the Market, entails evaluating companies based on two metrics: earnings yield (EBIT/enterprise value) and return on capital. Greenblatt is one of the few fund managers who have regularly achieved double-digit percentage returns during their careers on Wall Street. His former business, Gotham Capital, had an incredible run from 1985 until 1994. During this time, the fund generated a net return of 34%. That said, even he was conscious that this method seemed too wonderful and easy to be true, which is why, throughout his book, he frequently questions the reader: what is the assurance, if any, that this investment technique genuinely works and is not just a fluke? In any case, he frequently underlines that the Magic Formula investment technique does not encourage investing in firms with average or low return on capital since the strategy creates a rating system to identify top companies with the best return on capital and earnings yield.\n",
      "However, like with any method, there is some risk involved, and the Magic Formula does not ensure success. Since the strategy is based on past data, it’d be difficult to say if it could work well in the future, especially if market conditions change. Incidentally, a backtest of market performance from 2003 to 2015 found that the Magic Formula approach produced annualized returns of 11.4%, while the S&P 500 produced returns of 8.7%, thus failing to live up to Greenblatt’s inflated claims despite beating the benchmark. Greenblatt himself admits that the Magic Formula fails in many cases and performs poorly in some others, particularly when the holding time is too short. The investor stated the following:\n",
      "“Most people just won’t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won’t stick with it. After a year or two of performing worse than the market averages (or earning lower returns than their friends), most people look for a new strategy— usually one that has done well over the past few years. Even professional money managers who believe their strategy will work over the long term have a hard time sticking with it.”\n",
      "More recently, however, Joel Greenblatt’s fund appears to have lagged behind the overall market as a result of his investment strategy. As of the end of January, the Gotham Large Value Fund (GVALX) has only returned 10.86% over the last five years, while the S&P 500 has returned 15.17%. Nonetheless, the Magic Formula is one of many investment strategies that investors can opt for as they navigate the stock market.\n",
      "To make our list of the best Magic Formula stocks, we ranked the stocks in Gotham Asset Management’s Q4 2024 SEC filings by their stake value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n",
      "Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n",

      "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global technology firm best known for its main products, the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its vast suite of services, which includes Apple Music and iCloud. The company has also made strides in the AI sector by introducing its intelligence system, Apple Intelligence.\n",
      "On February 4, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating and $270 price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing Sensor Data data that showed Apple’s App Store sales increased by 2.7% month-over-month in January, exceeding the historical average growth rate of 2.3% from December to January.\n",
      "In the first quarter of 2025, the tech giant reported quarterly revenues of $124.3 billion, up 4% year on year, and quarterly diluted profits per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Apple CEO Tim Cook described this as the company’s “best quarter ever.”\n",
      "In its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n",
      "“Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.”\n",
      "Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best magic formula stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n",
